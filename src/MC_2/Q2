Difference between wait() and sleep() and code implementation.

Wait
----------------------
It is used for inter-thread communication.
A thread calls wait() to release its monitor lick and give other thread a chance to execute.
A thread in the wait() state can be resumed only by calling notify() or notifyAll()
on the same object.
java.lang.Object


Sleep:
----------------------
Primarily used to pause the current thread for a specified time
java.lang.Thread
Does not need to be called in a synchronized block because it does not release the lock.
